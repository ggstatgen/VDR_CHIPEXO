#Following Ram's question about getting r^2 LD blocks, I am running LDexplorer (mig) on the data. I also emailed Luke Ward who created Haploreg to ask if he would share with me the bed files with the blocks. Failing these two, I'm now trying to generate the LD blocks bed directly from Haploreg output data.
